As you design software to satisfy requirements, you have to make many important decisions. Certain design decisions involve trade-offs in different quality attributes such as performance, convenience and security. 

Finally project realities will impose compromises on your design. You must balance the software qualities with the resources you have to develop your product. Thinking about quality attributes gives a broader view on how you can achieve the desired requirements in your design. You now understand these qualities as competing ideals that must be balanced. When asked to satisfy a quality, you will consider multiple perspectives and look for potential trade-offs.
