This technique uses CRC cards where CRC stands for Class, Responsibility, Collaborator. Similar to how note cards help you organize your talking points, CRC cards help you to organize your components into classes, identify the responsibilities and determine how they will collaborate with each other. 

Much like how note cards are used to organize your talking points, CRC cards are used to record, organize and refine the components in your design. Again, CRC stands for Class, Responsibility and Collaborator. A CRC card has three sections. The top of the card has the class name. On the left are the responsibilities of the class, and on the right, you list collaborators. Collaborators are other classes that the class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities. 

A CRC card can be as simple as a physical index card marked into three sections. They are cheap, editable and widely available. CRC cards are small on purpose, so you can't write much on them. This forces you to keep breaking down each component into smaller components and eventually, classes that are small enough to be individually described on index cards. 

Using note cards won't guarantee a great speech and you still need to be experienced in speech writing to be able to arrange your talking points properly. Similarly, you still need to be knowledgeable of various design techniques in order to define your CRC cards and form your design properly.
