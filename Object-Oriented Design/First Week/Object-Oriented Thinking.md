When solving a problem, object-oriented modeling involves the practice of representing key concepts through objects in your software. Depending on the problem, many concepts, even instances of people, places or things become distinct objects in the software. 

So why should you use objects to represent things in your code? It is a way of keeping your code organized, flexible and reusable. It keeps code organized by having related details and specific functions in distinct, easy to find places. This creates flexibility because you can easily change details in a modular way without affecting the rest of the code. You can also reuse code and keep your program simple. 

With object-oriented thinking, you often think of everything as objects even living things. And all these objects are self-aware even inanimate things. object-oriented modeling will be a major topic of the work that you do in this specialization. 

Start viewing the world around you in terms of objects. It will help you out when you're called upon to design software using object-oriented Modeling. Think objects.
