Typically, the software designer role would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities. 
A software architect role would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other. 

That brings us to the primary difference between software design and software architecture. In short, software design looks at the lower level aspects of a system, whereas software architecture tends to look at the bigger picture, the higher level aspects of a system. 

Software design and architecture is essential to the software development process.
