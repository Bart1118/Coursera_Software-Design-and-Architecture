## UML Sequence Diagram

Sequence Diagrams are used to show your team how objects in your program interact with each other to complete tasks. 

Simply put, think of a sequence diagram like a map of conversations between different people, where this map follows all the messages sent from person to person. 


Let's say that a person wants to order a burger at a local fast food restaurant, here is a simple sequence diagram of the scenario.

That person will go to a restaurant and talk to the cashier and order a burger. 

The cashier will then talk to the chef of the back to tell him my order. 

The shuffle cook the burger, give it to the cashier. 

And the cashier will give it to the person. 

Now, let's go into more detail, because a sequence diagram is another type of UML diagram, to fully understand it, you should have a good grasp of objects and basic UML class diagrams. Knowing how to break down a system into classes is essential in creating meaningful sequence diagrams. 

A sequence diagram describes how objects in your system interact to complete a specific task.

When creating sequence diagrams, first you use a box to represent role play by an object. The role is typically labeled by the name of the class for the object.

Second, you use vertical dotted lines, known as lifelines, to represent an object as time passes by.

Finally, you use arrows to show messages that are sent from one object to another.
