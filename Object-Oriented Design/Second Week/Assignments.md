## Practice Peer-graded Assignment: Ungraded Assignment - UML Class Diagram

**Assignment Topic:**

_“Draw a UML class diagram of an Object-Oriented model for a car rental company that keeps track of cars, renters and renters renting cars ”_

Create a UML class diagram to represent this information. Showing the correct classes and relationships is enough. **Do not** add attributes or methods to the classes.

**Hint:** You may want to make a class for "renters renting cars".

**Note:** This is an ungraded assignment for practice. The goal is to help you get familiar with our assessments (Peer Review) in our system.

**How to submit:**

You will be expected to upload a PDF of your UML class diagram. A free online tool you may use to make your diagram is [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/). Note that you will have to make an account for this tool.

## Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Assignment 1.1 – UML Class Diagram

**Guidelines for the assignment**

Review these Lectures to aid you on your assignment:

1.2.7 - Abstraction in Java and UML

1.2.8 - Encapsulation in Java and UML

1.2.9 - Decomposition in Java and UML

1.2.10 - Generalization with Inheritance in Java and UML

**How to create your assignment**

**(1) Become familiar with the code:**

In its current state, a user of the app—the owner—is able to record the items they own and wish to share.

The owner may view all of their items, their “Available” items, or their “Borrowed” items.

The owner may change the status of an item they own from “Available” to “Borrowed” and back.

When an item’s status is changed to “Borrowed”, the owner must enter the username of the borrower.

Review the user stories, then download, examine, and run the code base provided.

**(2) Construct a diagram:**

After you have become familiar with the code, construct a UML class diagram that captures the following **six classes** and **three types of relationships** in the code base. For each class, you should document all attributes and methods.

**The** **six** **classes are:**

-   AppCompatActivity
-   AddItemActivity
-   EditItemActivity
-   ItemList 
-   Item 
-   Dimensions

**The** **three types** **of relationships are:**

-   Aggregation
-   Composition
-   Inheritance
