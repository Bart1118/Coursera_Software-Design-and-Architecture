Ted begins his career in the 1960s. In these days, the two most popular programming languages were COBOL and Fortran. They followed an imperative paradigm which broke up large programs into smaller programs called subroutines, which are like methods in Java. 

Now back in the 1960s, computer processing time was costly. As a result, it was important to maximize processing performance. Algol 68 and Pascal support the notion of an abstract data type, which is a datatype that is defined by the programmer and not built into the language. 

As we continue on our journey into the mid-1970s, computer processing time became less expensive while human labor became more expensive. The time consuming factor in software development was now the human element. New languages arose such as C and Modula-2 that provided a means to organize programs and allow developers to more easily create multiple but unique copies of their abstract data types. 

In the final leg of our journey, let's follow Ted into the 1980s. During this time in software history, the concepts of Object-Oriented Design, that are central for object-oriented programming, became popular.
